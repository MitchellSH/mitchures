            When it comes to software development, I specialize in <em>UI/UX</em> and{" "}
            <em>full-stack web development</em> using the latest techniques and concepts to build
            minimally designed and collaborative solutions for both clients and associates.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a developer, I enjoy utilizing modern frameworks and technologies such as{" "}
            <em>React</em> or <em>Vue</em> to create interactive user experiences while writing
            clean and semantic code. With a passion for self-learning, I strive to improve and
            challenge myself by applying industry best practices and staying informed with emerging
            trends.

            Aside from programming, I also have a great interest in film and photography, especially
            35mm slide film. You can often find me traversing through the streets of Oahu, metering
            light, and taking candid shots of folk with my trusty <em>Leica M6</em> and a roll of{" "}
            <em>Fujichrome Provia 100F</em>.

            When I'm not snapping photos or coding, one might also find me sipping on an{" "}
            <em>Aviation</em> while reading up on the history of classic cocktails as its told by{" "}
            <em>David Wondrich</em> and his take on the culture of mixology.
